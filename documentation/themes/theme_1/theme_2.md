# Initiatives:

- Improve website development process through DevOps automation and collaboration.

## Epics:

### 1. Version Control
- Goal: Implement version control system for codebase.
- User Stories:
    - As a developer, I want to use Git for version control, so that I can track changes to the codebase and collaborate with team members.
- Tasks:
    1. Install and configure Git on development machines.
    2. Create a new Git repository for the website codebase.
    3. Create a branching strategy for development and production releases.
- Test Cases:
    - Automated:
        - Verify Git is installed and configured correctly.
        - Verify repository creation and cloning.
        - Verify branch creation and switching.
    - Manual:
        - Review branching strategy with team members.

### 2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Goal: Automate the build, test, and deployment process.
- User Stories:
    - As a developer, I want to use a CI/CD tool to automate the build, test, and deployment process, so that I can quickly and reliably release new features and fixes to production.
- Tasks:
    1. Choose and install a CI/CD tool (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI).
    2. Create a build script for the website codebase.
    3. Configure the CI/CD tool to trigger builds on code changes.
    4. Configure the CI/CD tool to deploy builds to a test environment.
- Test Cases:
    - Automated:
        - Verify build script runs without errors.
        - Verify CI/CD tool triggers builds on code changes.
        - Verify deployments to test environment.
    - Manual:
        - Review test environment for expected changes.

### 3. Containerization
- Goal: Package application and dependencies into containers.
- User Stories:
    - As a developer, I want to use containerization tools to package the application and its dependencies into a single portable unit, so that I can deploy the application consistently across different environments.
- Tasks:
    1. Choose and install a containerization tool (e.g. Docker).
    2. Define Dockerfiles to build containers for the website application and its dependencies.
    3. Configure the CI/CD tool to build and push containers to a container registry.
- Test Cases:
    - Automated:
        - Verify Dockerfiles build containers without errors.
        - Verify containers are pushed to container registry.
    - Manual:
        - Review containers with team members.

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- Goal: Monitor website performance and availability.
- User Stories:
    - As a developer, I want to use monitoring tools to track website performance and availability, so that I can respond quickly to issues and optimize website performance.
- Tasks:
    1. Choose and install monitoring tools (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana).
    2. Define metrics to monitor (e.g. server response time, error rate).
    3. Configure monitoring tools to collect and display metrics.
    4. Configure alerting rules to notify team members of issues.
- Test Cases:
    - Automated:
        - Verify metrics are collected and displayed correctly.
        - Verify alerting rules trigger notifications on issues.
    - Manual:
        - Review metrics and alerting rules with team members.
        
### 5. Automation
- Goal: Automate repetitive tasks.
- User Stories:
    - As a developer, I want to use automation tools to automate repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and scaling, so that I can focus on more valuable work.
- Tasks:
    1. Choose and install automation tools (e.g. Puppet, Chef).
    2. Define automation scripts for repetitive tasks (e.g. database backup, server scaling).
- Test Cases:
    - Automated:
        - Verify automation scripts run without errors.
        - Verify tasks are completed as expected.
    - Manual:
        - Review automation scripts with team members.
