      - Task 2: Write automated tests for website functionality and user interactions, including Google Analytics tracking code.
      - Task 3: Run automated tests regularly and integrate them into our development process to catch and fix issues as early as possible.

- Initiative 2: Set up development, production, and testing processes
  - Epic 1: Set up local development environment
    - User Story 1: As a developer, I want to set up a local development environment, so that I can work on website code and test changes before committing them to the main codebase.
      - Task 1: Install a local development server and configure it to match our production server environment.
      - Task 2: Set up version control using Git and create a local code repository for website development.
  - Epic 2: Set up production server environment
    - User Story 2: As a developer, I want to set up a production server environment, so that we can deploy our website and make it available to the public.
      - Task 1: Choose a hosting provider and set up a production server that closely matches our local development environment, and configure it to work with our chosen hosting provider.
